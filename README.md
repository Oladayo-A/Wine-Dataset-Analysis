# Wine-Dataset-Analysis
The Wine Dataset consists of 5 columns; name of the wine, region where the wine is produced, variety of the wine, rating of the wine and a short note about the wine. The dataset has a total of 32980 entries.

We perform some analysis to see whatever insights we can get from the dataset and determine how the regions relate to the varieties of wine, the number of wines produced in each region, the different quality of wine in different regions and many more conclusions we can draw from the data. We will be using the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to visualize our data.
